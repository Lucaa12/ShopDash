ShopDash is a modern e-commerce dashboard and landing page designed to give store owners a clear view of their business. I handled the full UI/UX design and frontend development, focusing on clean visuals, intuitive layout, and responsive design. The dashboard features interactive charts, KPI cards, and customer segmentation, while the landing page highlights key product features and includes strong calls to action to drive signups.
